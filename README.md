Kickstarter Analysis

Project Overview:
Analyze Kickstarter campaign data to identify trends related to launch dates and funding goals. Provide visual aids to represent trends.
	
Purpose:
Our client is planning to crowdfund her play. This project will examine global crowdfunding data to identify the common factors between successful campaigns. Visual aids will be provided that will help our client gain greater understanding of the complete crowdfunding process and insights into their planning. She will then be able to model her personal campaign after other similar successful ones to maximize her chances of success. Some guiding factors include:
* ~$12,000.00 budget

Analysis:
•	Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date:
The launch date data provides insight into theater campaigns. The graph shows the peak of successful campaigns in May. The largest number of failed campaigns also occurs during May. The beginning of the year has the most cancellations occurring in January. October has zero cancellations. Another important trend highlighted by the graph is the distance between the failed and successful points at the successful peak. This is the largest separation between successful and failed while the failed point is below the max. Fnally, during the month of Decemberand successful campaigns are almost 
equal. 

 

•	Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals:
Inspection of the goal data yields some interesting results. First, the information represented in this graph is play specific making it more tailored to the planned campaign. It shows zero cancellations among plays. Successful and failed campaigns are equal in the fifteen thousand plus range. The forty-five thousand to fifty thousand range has the largest separation of failed and successful campaigns. It is the maximum of failed campaigns and minimum of successful campaigns. The largest separation with successful being the largest comes in January.

 

•	Challenges and Difficulties Encountered:
There were many obstacles to overcome. Most notable were the charts. The goal chart is based on data presented in the table above it. When originally formatting the percentages ROUND() was used to achieve the required result. While this had the desired effect, the chart could not reference that data correctly. This meant the y-axis on the chart lacked percentage symbols making it ambiguous. The scale was also set from 0 to 1.2. This meant that even though the chart still had the correct data, it was much harder to interpret. 86% is much more intuitive than .86 when presented to a new user. 

Results:
•	Based on the launch result data May provides the highest chance of success with the largest separation from failed and cancelled. February holds the second highest chances. December has a almost a fifty/fifty chance of either succeeding or failing, withholding the three cancellations.

•	Examining the goal data shows those cancellations to be a non-factor due to the complete lack of cancellations in the play subcategory. The most successful campaigns occur in the < $1000 range and progressively decline until the thirty-five to forty thousand range where it experiences a brief upturn before bottoming out at zero. Successful campaigns outnumber Failed campaigns the most at the beginning of the year and continue to do so until the fifteen thousand range. This means while there is a greater chance of success at much lower or much higher goals, there is still a small chance of success. In conclusion the campaign would have the best chances if started in May. The ten-thousand-dollar goal is possible, but real consideration should be given to increasing the goal to the more favorable twenty-five thousand range.

•	Some limitations of this data set include the source of the data. Data from Kickstarter is being used but there are many other crowdfunding platforms. Some of these may be more suitable to reaching a specific target audience, in this case plays. The data is not as current as it could be with its data ending in 2017. A lot can change in four years, especially the interest of the people.
•	Other graphs could provide greater insight. The outcomes based on launch date of just plays would be helpful and allow more detailed planning. Data on the individual months of high interest would also valuable. A table with chart for May, January, October, and December would provide greater accuracy for successful planning.
